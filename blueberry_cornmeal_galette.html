    <h1>How to make Blueberry Cornmeal Galette</h1>
    <img src="/images/Blueberry.jpg" alt="Blueberry cornmeal galette image">
    <p>I like making pie just as much as the next guy likes making pie, but I like making a galette even more. They're more fun, and I like the freedom that the rustic appearance affords. But mostly, I think I just enjoy the higher crust to fruit ratio. Serve with ice cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fine salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, cornmeal, and salt in a bowl with a pastry blender. Add cold butter and combine with the pastry blender until coarse crumbs form. Drizzle in cold water, a little at a time, stirring to combine with a fork, until dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Turn dough onto a work surface and bring together with your hands; press into a disk of dough.</li>
        <li>Wrap dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat® baking mat.</li>
        <li>Combine blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cornstarch in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Remove dough from the refrigerator and roll on a lightly floured work surface into a 15-inch circle, about 1/8 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Place blueberry filling into the center of the dough, leaving 3 to 4 inches of space around the border of dough. Fold dough up and around the berries, rotating a few inches and make another fold, overlapping the first; repeat around the dough until pleats are formed.</li>
        <li>Combine beaten egg and water in a small bowl and brush on the dough. Sprinkle on demerara sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until golden, about 45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
